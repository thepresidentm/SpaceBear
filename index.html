                Space is a very dangerous place to be, there is no oxygen and gravity however  humans are very courious and we like extreme challenges so, long ago we reached space but now we affront another challenge, our years of space exploration had involuntary results one of the most important of them is ‚ÄúSpace Junk‚Äù.

            <h2>Space Junk?</h2>
            <p>
                The most valuable tool for humans is our intelligence, we use knowledge to do the impossible, with the knowledge we create specific tools to solve specific problems, we call these solutions technology, as you can imagine a human alone cannot reach the space but a group of humans with technology can.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually, our technology is very complex but even today has problems like efficiency and control; the technology that we need to reach space produces junk and we live in a very complex world that even our best simulations of it aren't enough to predict everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the space junk comes from the disintegration, explosion, or collision of the approximately 8950 satellites put in orbit.

            <h2>Consequences</h2>
            <p>
                Space isn't just an amazing place where nerds can imagine science fiction stories, actually, we need space to do a lot of useful things, like science, air traffic management, or even Uber and Google Maps. Can you imagine a world without Google Maps? At least I can‚Äôt do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do anything in space we need to put things in it, things like satellites or spaceships, you can imagine the space junk like a hailstorm, but instead of ice, it has lots of metal pieces that could easily kill you, kill your dog and destroy your house.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="kesslerSyndrome">
            <h2>Kessler Syndrome</h2>
            <p>
                The Kessler Syndrome in a few words means ‚ÄúThe end of space‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p>
                If even a piece of space junk just about 3 millimeters has the same energy as a bullet you can imagine what a bigger piece could do; space junk can destroy satellites, those destroyed satellites produce more space junk that can destroy other satellites, this could start a collision cascade where space junk produce more space junk, if this happens we could reach a point where putting anything on the space is basically impossible.
